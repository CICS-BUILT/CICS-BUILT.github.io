introduction: |
  B[U]ILT (Black, Indigenous, and Latinx in Tech) is a UMass Amherst College of Information and Computer Science student organization fighting for racial equity in the tech industry.
  We aim to provide individuals of said races and their allies what is needed to advocate for and achieve racial equality in tech.
  This will be achieved through things like career events, community discussion, and talks with industry professionals.

  What actually is B[U]ILT?
  - Itâ€™s an organization to meet awesome folks that are interested in tech and/or want to enter tech.
  - A place where people can have open discussion and be supported regarding matters impacting them.
  - A way for the underrepresented minority students of CICS to band together and be heard by faculty and administration.
  - An opportunity to learn more and get tips about careers in tech from peers and industry partners.
